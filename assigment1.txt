1.difference between http1.1 vs http hhtp2
  
 *HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1. 
 *HTTP1 loads a single request for every TCP connection, while HTTP2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing. 
 *HTTP is a network delay sensitive protocol in the sense that if there is less network delay, then the page loads faster.
 *HTTP1.1 used to process text commands to complete request.
 *HTTP2 will use binary commands to execute the same task.

2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

 *Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript.
 *These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types
           *Number
           *String
           *Boolean
           *nul
           *undefined
           *symbol
 *all store a single value each depending on their types.
 *Objects are more complex 
 *each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
